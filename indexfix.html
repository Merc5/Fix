    <h2 class="zetsu">About Us</h2>

    <p>
        <em style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">THE NEED</em> 
        According to UNICEF, there are currently 3.9 million orphans in South Africa. Without the support of parents, this orphan generation is subject to extreme stigma, exploitation, neglect, 
        disease and a host of other circumstances unseen by any previous generation. Whether on the streets or heading a household at 12 years old, they are twice as likely to discontinue their 
        chooling and twice as likely to contract HIV/AIDS. 
    </p>
    <p>
        <em style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">THE CALL</em>
        In 2016, the New Life Children’s Home was established as a non-profit organisation. Our aim is to provide quality care in a safe and loving home for vulnerable children, irrespective of 
        race, gender or age. We want to give children the opportunity to have a new life – filled with hope, excitement, faith and love. We also want to protect and encourage all the children 
        we help through focus on positive behaviour and Godly principles
    </p>
    <p>
        <em style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">THE ANSWER</em>
        Through research and interaction with those who are trying to solve the orphan crisis in our city, we have come up with a children’s home model that we believe will make a permanent and 
        positive change in the lives of all the children involved. We want to create a beautiful home for over 40 children – a place that children can be proud of calling home. We believe this 
        can be done best by creating a state of the art ‘container home’ with well designed and welcoming spaces. 
    </p>
    <p>
        <em style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">THE PLEDGE</em>
        As with any big project, the New Life Children’s Home is going to require funding in order to launch and run. We are very privileged to already have received land and sponsorship to 
        build a few of the homes already.  We are looking for businesses and individuals to partner with us for this great cause. Corporate donations are not only tax deductible, but will also 
        count towards the BEE spend. Together we really can make a lasting difference – bringing new life to those who need it most.

                    The Yellow Home, our first residence, officially opened on September 24th, 2018! Nine people now live there, including a houseparent who has become their mother and nine children who have grown into brothers and sisters.

                The Orange Home, our second residence, became operational on June 16th, 2019. Because this house was constructed for the "Fatherless Youth" in the city, it was Father's Day and Youth Day on this special day for us. In addition, this was the first house with a separate ground-floor disability unit. A lovely family of nine children, a house mother, and a full-time caregiver are now living in this house.

              <h4>Awesome Fact</h4>
              <p>One thing about midnight feeds is you're awake when the rest of your household sleeps and as I sit here catching up on the inevitable news spreading of baby Jabu's story, I feel I need to help clarify a few things.  
                Baby safes are illegal. Yes, we're a christian church organisation and we built something that is not legal in our country {yet}.  Abandonment of a child of any age is and always should be against the law.  However, 
                there is a group of people actively fighting to legalise 'safe surendering' of a baby.  Why? Because we've all read one too many articles about babies found in toilets, taxi ranks or bushes and if you've ever been at 
                a crime scene when a baby's body was recovered, it changes you.  Deep down in your core something urges you to start fighting a system that allows this to happen.  
                For every baby found alive, 2 are found dead.  And I know everyone's first instinct is to judge the mom. It's hard not to do that.  BUT, unemployment, rape, drugs, generational poverty - have you tried and I mean really
                 triéd to understand how these things are affecting our society?  And yes I know there's a case to be made for contraceptives, but this is a different conversation and not the point here.  
                The point is, moms need a safe and anonymous space where they can trust that their babies will be cared for and they (the moms) will be free of persecution.  It's the only way to save these babies.  Our neighbouring 
                country, Namibia has just legalised baby safes and many countries across the world have done so before. It's time South Africa does the same!  Presentations have been made to parliament and the work has been done behind 
                the scenes.  Today, take a step and put your social media to use. Let's show our support to the people helping these babies and their first moms.  
                Share why you think legislation needs to change and make <b>#LegaliseSafeAbandonment</b> trend today.</p>
