        <em style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">THE NEED</em> 
        According to UNICEF, there are currently 3.9 million orphans in South Africa. Without the support of parents, this orphan generation is subject to extreme stigma, exploitation, neglect, 
        disease and a host of other circumstances unseen by any previous generation. Whether on the streets or heading a household at 12 years old, they are twice as likely to discontinue their 
        chooling and twice as likely to contract HIV/AIDS. 
    </p>
    <p>
        <em style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">THE CALL</em>
        In 2016, the New Life Children’s Home was established as a non-profit organisation. Our aim is to provide quality care in a safe and loving home for vulnerable children, irrespective of 
        race, gender or age. We want to give children the opportunity to have a new life – filled with hope, excitement, faith and love. We also want to protect and encourage all the children 
        we help through focus on positive behaviour and Godly principles
    </p>
    <p>
        <em style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">THE ANSWER</em>
        Through research and interaction with those who are trying to solve the orphan crisis in our city, we have come up with a children’s home model that we believe will make a permanent and 
        positive change in the lives of all the children involved. We want to create a beautiful home for over 40 children – a place that children can be proud of calling home. We believe this 
        can be done best by creating a state of the art ‘container home’ with well designed and welcoming spaces. 
    </p>
    <p>
        <em style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">THE PLEDGE</em>
        As with any big project, the New Life Children’s Home is going to require funding in order to launch and run. We are very privileged to already have received land and sponsorship to 
        build a few of the homes already.  We are looking for businesses and individuals to partner with us for this great cause. Corporate donations are not only tax deductible, but will also 
        count towards the BEE spend. Together we really can make a lasting difference – bringing new life to those who need it most.

                    The Yellow Home, our first residence, officially opened on September 24th, 2018! Nine people now live there, including a houseparent who has become their mother and nine children who have grown into brothers and sisters.

                The Orange Home, our second residence, became operational on June 16th, 2019. Because this house was constructed for the "Fatherless Youth" in the city, it was Father's Day and Youth Day on this special day for us. In addition, this was the first house with a separate ground-floor disability unit. A lovely family of nine children, a house mother, and a full-time caregiver are now living in this house.
